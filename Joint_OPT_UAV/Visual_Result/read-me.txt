This is NOT the results from the main code, it is a minimal non-convex optimization in casADi only to give you the sense.

This is a 2-d representaion of UAV Base stations " X " to users " O " in 1000 time steps.

Operation Height of UAVs is fixed, therefore a 2-d representation could be achieved.

every line connecting j-th O with i-th X, means in that specific time step, user j is scheduled and receives service
from UAV i.
